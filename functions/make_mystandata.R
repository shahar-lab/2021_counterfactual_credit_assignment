#aim: create data that can passed in to stan. Variables will be passed as subject x trial matrices.
#     These matrices are padded with Inf value to have exactly the same number of trials despite missing values
#contributors: Nitzan Shahar, Shira Niv
#inputs:
#data - is your data frame
#subject_column - is the specific vector of subjects from you data frame (e.g., data$subjectID)
#Ntrials_per_subject - is a vector 1 x Nsubj with each cell including the number of available trials per subject
#subjects_list - is a vector with the subjects id
#var_toinclude - is a vector of strings with the names of data columns that should be included in the stan data
#var_tobenamed - is a vector of strings for how to variables should be names according to stan model (in case the data and stan has different names for the same var)
